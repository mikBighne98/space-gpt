Drive UI lets you inspect, add, delete files from a Drive via a GUI.

### Opening Drive UI

You can open the Drive UI of an app instance by opening an app's context menu and clicking "View Data".

In the now open dialog navigate to the "Drive" tab and all the files and folders from within the path `/` should load into the table view. 


### Preview and Navigation

Files that are previewable (and folders) are marked in blue.
